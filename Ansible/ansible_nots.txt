To verify the indentation
ansible-playbook --syntax-check git.yaml

To run in debug mode


To list available servers under the host group
ansible all --list -i /etc/ansible/hosts


172.31.30.227 -- master
172.31.16.131 -- slave-1

To run any command
ansible all -m shell -a 'hostname'

Uses of Ansible

ansible is an configuration management tool
which means in order to work your applications there are some dependecies like upgrades or some install applications or some changes to an exitsing setup which needs to be done on multiple sytem and this is impossible to do it manually on all systems.
that is the reasons we use ansible.
for examaple if you want to install any software on all server, by using the ansible we can directly install on all serveres withour directly accessing or manually acccessing the servers.
Which saves lot of time and reduces human efforts

this is written in python we have lot of modules which helps us to configure or write playbooks easily

YAML
This is written in YAML which is markup language
easy to understand

Change Management
Using the ansible we can deploy the changes easily in to the platform.

Agent less
all slaves are no need to install any ansible dependecies 
no need to setup any agents

No extra softwares
 required

No complex upgraders

Simple and human understandable 
which meas easy to understand and easy to update the current programs/yaml files

N Number of Modules
lot of modules are available 

No complex hings
easy to understand

Used for orchestration 

Automation of tasks
easy to tasks

Provisioning
Using AWS cli commands and we can provisioning any servers
Check AWS cli moules
infra provisioning & configurations

ideampotancy f(x(x))=f(x)
if you download any file then if you try to redownload it then it won't download 
same for installing any software
if you already installed java, then again if you try to install java, it won't reinstall

key-based mechanism
ansible works on key based mechanism which means the master node connect with slaves using the key-based mechanism
we are exchaning the master key to the slave nodes for inter connection

As deplymemt and configuration tool
we can se this as a deplpyment and configuration tool

Slides explaination:
Well, I have explained what each line does

name Name of the playbook

hosts A set of hosts usually grouped together as a host group and defined in inventory file

become To tell ansible this play has to be executed with elevated privileges

become_user the user name that we want to switch to like compare it with sudo su - user

tasks set of tasks to execute, All tasks would be defined below this
